Exploring Data with Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and SARIMAX
After exploring the data and examining its details and information, I checked the balance of my target variable. Additionally, I performed cleaning to remove null rows. Now, let's define some variables to further explore our data, examining the ranges in time and the maximum and minimum values within different intervals.

From the selected variables, we will choose some as our features. Then, we can utilize SARIMAX, a robust algorithm suitable for time series data, particularly effective for features indexed by time and predicting time-based regressions.
